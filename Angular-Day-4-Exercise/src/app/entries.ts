        description: "The Tsukiji Fish Market was one of the most iconic staples of the city. In 2018, the market moved to Toyosu and is now twice the size of the original Tsukiji market. In fact, the new market is the largest fish market in the entire world. While you’ll need a visitor’s pass to enter (you can get one on arrival), the pass is free (which means you’ll have more money to spend on sushi!)",

        description: "The Imperial Palace is the official home of the Emperor of Japan. It’s a terrific spot to learn about Japan’s history and culture. Formerly Edo Castle, the palace was built in the 15th century, and some of the walls and moats from that time are still in use to this day. When the Emperor moved from Kyoto to Tokyo in 1869, he took Edo for his new palace and renamed it the Imperial Palace.",

        description: "Ueno Park is a relaxing and beautiful spot to relax for a few hours (or an entire day if you’re not in a rush). It’s a serene spot to photograph the many cherry trees that line the park (which blossom in April and are a huge tourist draw) or to have a picnic on a sunny summer afternoon.",
