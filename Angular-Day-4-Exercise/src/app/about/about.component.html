<h1>Hello there, nice to meet you!</h1>

<h3>About me</h3>

<p>I'm Lena, a wanderlust since my earliest youth and equipped with a large portion of curiosity about the world. I have a preference for road trips and nature/outdoor adventures, but also exciting discoveries in the urban jungle and do not shy away from winter and countries with bad weather. I like to do individual travel with style and prefer active travel to beach vacations. So you'll find me more in the mountains than on the beach (but maybe I'm sitting in my pajamas on my couch in Korneuburg and already planning the next trip - who knows...). On my travels I prefer the small, local and sustainable and am always looking for special experiences, discoveries off the beaten track and new small and bigger adventures - on my own doorstep and worldwide!

    Six years ago I quit my agency job in social media monitoring & consulting, went traveling for several months and founded Black Dots White Spots. Since then, I haven't looked back. For the past five years, I've been self-employed as a travel blogger/writer, social media consultant and online editor, combining my two passions for the real, big wide world and the online world, and spending several months a year on the road. On Black Dots White Spots I share my travel adventures and discoveries with over 50,000 readers every month, give tips and travel inspiration and take you virtually with me to faraway places.</p>
